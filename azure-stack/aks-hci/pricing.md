# Pricing for AKS on Azure Stack HCI
Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) on Azure Stack HCI is a subscription-based on-premises Kubernetes offering that can be run on Azure Stack HCI version 20H2 or Windows Server 2019 Hyper-V clusters. The cost of AKS on Azure Stack HCI is based on usage, and the billing data is sent to Azure.

Use the following list to explore the pricing options:

- Billing unit: **per vCPU of running worker nodes within workload clusters**:
  - AKS on Azure Stack HCI management cluster usage is *not* charged
  - The workload cluster control plane and load balancer nodes are *not* charged
  - If you enable hyper-threading on the physical computer, which reduces the measured vCPU count by 50 percent.
- Pricing: **US $1.33 per vCPU (of running worker nodes) per day**:
  - All AKS on Azure Stack HCI deployments include a free 60-day evaluation period
- Includes Linux (CBL-Mariner) Container Hosts:
  - Pricing does not include Windows container hosts as they are licensed separately through regular licensing channels
  - Windows Server Standard: Unlimited Windows containers and two Hyper-V containers
  - Windows Server Datacenter: Unlimited Windows and Hyper-V containers
- Includes Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes at no extra charge and also the following items:
  - **Inventory, grouping, and tagging** in Azure
  - **Deploy apps and configurations with GitOps**: Included at no extra charge (normally, the initial six vCPUs are free, and then afterwards, the charge is $2 per vCPU per month)
  - **Azure Policy for Kubernetes**: Included at no extra charge (normally, the charge is $3 per vCPU per cluster for each month)

## Impact of hyper-threading
The AKS on Azure Stack HCI billing unit is a virtual core. If you enable hyper-threading on your physical computer, AKS on Azure Stack HCI will also enable hyper-threading on the worker nodes.  If you enable hyper-threading, it will effectively halve the number of virtual cores needed in each worker node.

## Pricing comparison summary

Use the table below to compare pricing options.

> There are additional details on pricing in the section that follows the table.

|Workload cluster configuration| AKS on Azure Stack HCI *with* hyper-threading (most common scenario) | AKS on Azure Stack HCI *without* hyper-threading |   AKS in Azure  |
|-----------------|---|---|---|
|**-2 Worker Nodes <br> -1 x (2 vCPU VM with Linux) <br> -1 x (8 vCPU VM with Windows) <br> -10 vCPUs Total**|~US $200 per month   |~US $400 per month    | ~US $350 per month   |
|**-4 Worker Nodes <br> -2 x (4 vCPU VM with Linux) <br> -2 x (4 vCPU VM with Windows) <br> -16 vCPUs Total**|~US $320 per month   |~US $640 per month    | ~US $561 per month   | 
|**Other information**| Includes Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes. <br> Does not include the cost of hardware, hypervisor, or Windows Server licenses. | Includes Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes. <br> Does not include the cost of hardware, hypervisor, or Windows Server licenses.   | Includes Arc-enabled Kubernetes and the underlying infrastructure. <br> Does not include the cost of running Windows Server on Azure.  | 


### Additional pricing notes

- AKS is consistently priced across on-premises deployment scenarios using either Windows Server or Azure Stack HCI as the host system. 
-	AKS on Azure Stack HCI pricing is based on the US currency list pricing with no discounts applied.
-	Running Windows Server containers on AKS on Azure Stack HCI requires a Windows Server license. The license can be acquired separately through regular licensing channels, or it can be added into the cost of running a Windows virtual machine on Azure. For users with Windows Server Software Assurance, Azure Hybrid benefits may apply, reducing or eliminating the Windows Server license fees.
-	For hyper-threading, price assumes hyper-threading is available and enabled on physical systems.
-	Azure Pricing for running workloads on AKS is based on US currency list pricing in the East US region with: pay-as-you-go pricing, D-series general purpose VM sizes (D2s v4, D4s V4, and D8s V4), standard HDD, and no uptime SLA in the included support level.
-	Monthly price estimates are based on 730 hours of usage. Price assumes that systems are running for the entire month.
